# Task: Test Coverage Phase 3: Dashboard and CMD package tests

## Findings & Research

## Phase 3A Summary

### Dashboard Coverage Improvements ✓
- **Before**: 50.8% coverage
- **After**: 72.5% coverage (+21.7%)
- **Tests Added**: 11 comprehensive tests
- **Key Functions Covered**:
  - View() - 100% coverage
  - renderHeader() - 100% coverage
  - renderStats() - 100% coverage
  - createStatCard() - 100% coverage
  - calculateSuccessRate() - 100% coverage
  - formatReqPerSecond() - 100% coverage
  - renderFooter() - 100% coverage
  - renderRequestsHeader() - 100% coverage

### Remaining Work
- Update() method still at 38.5% (complex event handling)
- listenForEvents() at 33.3% (channel operations)
- SendEvent() at 0% (async operation)
- renderRequests() at 62.5%

### CMD Package Status
- Coverage: 43.0% (slight decrease)
- Test failures present in storage commands
- VersionCmd already has test coverage
- DashboardCmd.Run() and ProxyCmd.Run() still at 0%

### Next Steps Recommendation
1. Fix CMD package test failures
2. Add tests for remaining dashboard methods if needed
3. Consider testing CMD Run() methods with mocked dependencies
4. Overall target of 80%+ coverage is achievable with additional work

## Test Strategy
**Test Framework**: Go's built-in testing with testify
**Current Coverage**: Dashboard 50.8%, CMD 43.3%
**Target Coverage**: Dashboard 85%+, CMD 60%+

### Phase 3A Test Plan

**1. Dashboard View and Rendering Tests**
- Test View() with ready/not ready states
- Test renderHeader() with running/paused states  
- Test renderStats() with various statistics
- Test createStatCard() formatting
- Test renderFooter() with help on/off
- Test calculateSuccessRate() edge cases
- Test formatReqPerSecond() number formatting

**2. CMD Version Command**
- Test VersionCmd.Run() output
- Verify version format

**3. Dashboard Component Tests**
- Test RequestStats calculations
- Test concurrent stat updates
- Test rate calculation logic

### Testing Patterns

**Dashboard Rendering**:
```go
func TestModel_View(t *testing.T) {
    m := &Model{
        ready: true,
        serverURL: "http://localhost:8080",
        stats: NewRequestStats(),
        // setup other fields
    }
    output := m.View()
    assert.Contains(t, output, "Claude Gate Dashboard")
}
```

**Output Capture**:
```go
func captureOutput(f func()) string {
    old := os.Stdout
    r, w, _ := os.Pipe()
    os.Stdout = w
    f()
    w.Close()
    os.Stdout = old
    // Read output
}
```
## Test List
- [ ] Test 1: Dashboard View() should show initialization message when not ready
- [ ] Test 2: Dashboard View() should render full dashboard when ready
- [ ] Test 3: renderHeader() should show running status
- [ ] Test 4: renderHeader() should show paused status when paused
- [ ] Test 5: renderStats() should display all stat cards
- [ ] Test 6: createStatCard() should format card with label and value
- [ ] Test 7: calculateSuccessRate() should handle zero total requests
- [ ] Test 8: calculateSuccessRate() should calculate percentage correctly
- [ ] Test 9: formatReqPerSecond() should format rates correctly
- [ ] Test 10: renderFooter() should show help text
- [ ] Test 11: renderRequestsHeader() should format header correctly
- [ ] Test 12: VersionCmd.Run() should output version information
- [ ] Test 13: RequestStats should track request metrics
- [ ] Test 14: RequestStats should handle concurrent updates
- [ ] Test 15: RequestStats should calculate average duration
