# Task: Improve test coverage for claude-gate project

## Findings & Research

## CLI Testing Challenges

1. **Kong Framework**: The CLI uses Kong framework which has specific patterns for testing
2. **Tight Coupling**: Commands directly create their dependencies internally:
   - Storage factory created inside Run() methods
   - OAuth client created inside Run() methods
   - UI output created inside Run() methods
3. **Interactive Elements**: Commands use interactive UI components (confirm dialogs, spinners)
4. **External Dependencies**: OAuth flow requires browser interaction

## Alternative Testing Approach

Instead of refactoring the entire command structure, we can:
1. Test the command execution at a higher level using Kong's testing utilities
2. Focus on testing the underlying business logic (auth, storage, proxy)
3. Use integration tests for end-to-end command testing
4. Create focused unit tests for specific command logic that can be extracted

## Test Strategy

**Test Framework**: Go's built-in testing package with testify for assertions
**Test Types**: Unit tests for all packages
**Coverage Target**: 
  - Overall: 80%+
  - CLI commands: 80%+ (currently 0.2%)
  - Logger: 90%+ (currently 0%)
  - UI components: 70%+ (currently 0%)

**Testing Approach**:
1. **CLI Testing**: Use Kong's test utilities and mock dependencies
2. **Logger Testing**: Test initialization, formatting, and context handling
3. **UI Testing**: Test Bubble Tea models and component behavior
4. **Mock Strategy**: Create interfaces for external dependencies

**Key Testing Patterns**:
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive scenarios
- Mock OAuth client, storage, and HTTP clients
- Test both success and error paths
- Verify command output using captured stdout/stderr

**Current Coverage Analysis**:
- cmd/claude-gate: 0.2% (CRITICAL)
- internal/auth: 75.4% (Good)
- internal/config: 53.7% (Moderate)
- internal/proxy: 69.1% (Good)
- internal/ui/dashboard: 50.8% (Moderate)
- internal/ui/utils: 20.0% (Low)
- internal/logger: 0.0% (No tests)
- internal/ui/components: 0.0% (No tests)

**Test Implementation Order**:

### Phase 1: CLI Commands (Priority 1)
- [ ] Test 1: auth login command should handle successful authentication flow
- [ ] Test 2: auth login command should handle authentication errors
- [ ] Test 3: auth logout command should clear stored tokens
- [ ] Test 4: auth status command should show authentication state
- [ ] Test 5: start command should launch proxy server with default settings
- [ ] Test 6: start command should respect custom host/port flags
- [ ] Test 7: start command should handle authentication check failures
- [ ] Test 8: dashboard command should initialize TUI correctly
- [ ] Test 9: version command should display version information
- [ ] Test 10: storage list command should show available storages

### Phase 2: Logger Package
- [ ] Test 11: Logger should initialize with correct log level
- [ ] Test 12: Logger should parse log levels from strings
- [ ] Test 13: Logger should handle context operations
- [ ] Test 14: Logger should format output correctly

### Phase 3: UI Components
- [ ] Test 15: Dashboard should update stats from events
- [ ] Test 16: Dashboard should handle keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test 17: Components should render with correct styles
- [ ] Test 18: Spinner component should animate correctly

### Phase 4: Config Improvements
- [ ] Test 19: Config should handle all environment variables
- [ ] Test 20: GetBindAddress should format address correctly

3. Added comprehensive test suites for both packages
4. Established testing patterns for future tests

**Next Priority Areas:**
1. CLI commands (cmd/claude-gate) - needs major work
