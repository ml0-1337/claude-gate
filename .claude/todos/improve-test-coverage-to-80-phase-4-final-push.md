# Task: Improve test coverage to 80%+ - Phase 4 (Final push)

## Findings & Research

### Current Coverage Status
- Overall internal package coverage: 77.8%
- Target: 80%+
- Gap: ~2.2%

### Package Coverage Breakdown
1. **internal/auth**: 75.4% â†’ Target 90-95%
   - Missing: file_storage tests entirely
   - Partial: Error handling paths, migration logic
   
2. **internal/ui/components**: 70.5% â†’ Target 85-90%
   - Missing: AuthFlowUI wrapper methods (TTY-dependent)
   - Missing: Progress tracker functions
   - Missing: Helper functions (Confirm, RunSpinner, etc.)
   
3. **internal/ui/dashboard**: 72.5% â†’ Target 85-90%
   - Missing: request_log.go tests entirely
   - Partial: Event handling in Update()
   
4. **internal/ui/utils**: 30% â†’ Target 60-70%
   - Missing: SupportsColor, SupportsEmoji logic
   - TTY-dependent: ClearLine, MoveCursorUp (skip these)

### Priority Order
1. **VERY HIGH**: internal/auth - Security critical
2. **HIGH**: internal/ui/components - Core UI functionality
3. **HIGH**: internal/ui/dashboard - User-facing component
4. **MEDIUM**: internal/ui/utils - Terminal utilities

## Test Strategy

### Phase 4 Strategy: Targeted Coverage Improvements

**Goal**: Increase overall internal package coverage from 77.8% to 80%+

**Approach**: Focus on high-impact, low-effort improvements

### Priority 1: internal/auth (75.4% â†’ 90%+)
1. Create comprehensive tests for file_storage.go
2. Complete error handling paths in OAuth flow
3. Test storage migration scenarios
4. Mock file operations to avoid actual file I/O

### Priority 2: internal/ui/dashboard (72.5% â†’ 85%+)
1. Create tests for request_log.go
2. Complete Update() event handling tests
3. Test filter and clear functionality
4. Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage

### Priority 3: internal/ui/components (70.5% â†’ 80%+)
1. Skip TTY-dependent AuthFlowUI wrapper tests
2. Focus on testable helper functions
3. Test progress tracker state management
4. Mock time-based operations

### Priority 4: internal/ui/utils (30% â†’ 60%+)
1. Test environment variable detection logic
2. Skip TTY-dependent terminal operations
3. Focus on SupportsEmoji logic with various env vars
4. Test GetTerminalWidth edge cases
