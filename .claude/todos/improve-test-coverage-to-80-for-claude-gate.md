# Task: Improve test coverage to 80% for claude-gate project

## Findings & Research

## Web Searches

## Test Strategy
## Test Strategy

**Test Framework**: Go's built-in testing with testify
**Current Coverage**: 38.8%
**Target Coverage**: 80%+
**Test Types**: Unit tests with mocked dependencies

**Key Testing Approaches**:
1. **CLI Commands**: Mock Kong context and dependencies
2. **UI Components**: Mock Bubble Tea program execution
3. **Interactive Elements**: Programmatic input simulation
4. **Output Testing**: Capture stdout/stderr

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Create interfaces for all external dependencies
- Use testify/mock for consistent mocking
- Mock browser, keychain, OAuth flow
- Capture and verify output

## Test Cases
## Test List

### Phase 1: CLI Command Tests (cmd/claude-gate)
- [ ] Test 1: StartCmd should start proxy with default configuration
- [ ] Test 2: StartCmd should handle missing authentication
- [ ] Test 3: StartCmd should respect custom host/port flags
- [ ] Test 4: DashboardCmd should initialize TUI dashboard
- [x] Test 5: LoginCmd should handle OAuth flow with mock
- [x] Test 6: LogoutCmd should remove tokens with confirmation
- [x] Test 7: StatusCmd should display auth status correctly (already implemented)
- [ ] Test 8: TestCmd should check proxy connectivity (TTY issues - skip for now)

### Phase 2: Auth Storage Command Tests
- [x] Test 9: Storage commands should have proper structure (already implemented)
- [x] Test 10: Storage StatusCmd should show storage details (already implemented with issues)
- [x] Test 11: Storage TestCmd should verify storage operations (already implemented with issues)
- [ ] Test 12: MigrateCmd should migrate tokens between storages
- [ ] Test 13: BackupCmd should create token backups
- [ ] Test 14: ResetCmd should reset keychain items

### Phase 3: UI Output Tests (internal/ui)
- [x] Test 14: Output methods should format messages correctly
- [x] Test 15: Table rendering should handle various data
- [x] Test 16: Interactive mode detection should work
- [x] Test 17: Color and emoji support should be detected
- [x] Test 18: Box, List, Code formatting (additional tests)

### Phase 4: UI Component Tests
- [ ] Test 18: Spinner should update states correctly
- [ ] Test 19: Confirm dialog should handle user input
- [ ] Test 20: Auth flow component should manage states

### Phase 5: UI Utils Enhancement
- [ ] Test 21: Terminal utilities should detect features correctly

**Current Test**: Working on Phase 1

## Working Scratchpad
### Coverage Progress Summary

**Starting Point**: 38.8% total coverage

**After Phase 1 (CLI Commands)**:
- cmd/claude-gate: 1.7% → 30.3% (+28.6%)
- Overall: 38.8% → 45.4% (+6.6%)

**Current Package Status**:
✅ internal/config: 100.0% (excellent)
✅ internal/logger: 87.0% (excellent)
✅ internal/auth: 75.4% (good)
✅ internal/proxy: 69.8% (good)
⚠️ internal/ui/dashboard: 50.8% (moderate)
⚠️ cmd/claude-gate: 30.3% (improved but needs more)
❌ internal/ui/utils: 20.0% (low)
❌ internal/ui: 0.0% (no tests)
❌ internal/ui/components: 0.0% (no tests)
❌ internal/ui/styles: 0.0% (no tests)

**To Reach 80% Target**:
Need to add ~35% more coverage across:
1. More CLI command tests (especially actual Run methods)
2. UI package tests (output, oauth flow)
3. UI component tests (spinner, confirm, auth flow)
4. UI utils enhancement

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Kong CLI framework makes testing Run methods complex
- TTY requirements for some commands
- Bubble Tea TUI components hard to test
- Interactive elements need mocking
