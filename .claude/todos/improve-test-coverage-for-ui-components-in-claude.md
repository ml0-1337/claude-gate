# Task: Improve test coverage for UI components in claude-gate project

## Findings & Research
## Coverage Analysis Results

### Current Coverage Status
- `internal/ui`: 83.2% coverage
- `internal/ui/components`: 36.0% coverage (LOWEST)
- `internal/ui/dashboard`: 50.8% coverage  
- `internal/ui/styles`: 100.0% coverage (EXCELLENT)
- `internal/ui/utils`: 30.0% coverage (LOW)

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **auth_flow.go (285 lines) - 0% coverage**
   - No test file exists
   - All 12 functions untested
   - Core OAuth authentication UI component

2. **Helper Functions with 0% coverage:**
   - RunSpinner, SimpleSpinner (TTY-dependent)
   - NewProgressTracker, SimpleProgress
   - TimerWithCallback
   - OAuth flow helpers

3. **Dashboard View Functions with 0% coverage:**
   - Main View() method
   - All rendering helpers (renderHeader, renderStats, etc.)
   - Utility calculations

4. **Terminal utilities** - Low coverage in utils package

## Test Strategy
- **Test Framework**: Go standard testing + testify assertions
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for all UI components
- **Coverage Target**: Increase components from 36% to 80%+
- **Edge Cases**: TTY dependencies, interactive components, error states
- **Approach**: Start with auth_flow.go (0% coverage), then helper functions
